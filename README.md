# Implementation of a map with points of interest for the website of the Municipality of Western Samos

In collaboration with a student from the department where I studied, I created a digital map with points of interest (cultural, historical, touristic, etc.) for the website of the Municipality of Western Samos. This project started as an idea for work in the "Digital Governance" course of the department where we were studying. In this way we helped to highlight the Municipality where our department is located.
